# hello-world
A brand-new awesome repository 

Hi everyone! My name is Mari and I want to be a coder. It is my dream to be allowed to spend all day in front of my computer without getting yelled at for it.

I am switching jobs from managing a bunch of nightclubs in Paris, France, because tequila in such ridiculous quantities ends up being fairly bad for you, apparently.

So there you have it.
